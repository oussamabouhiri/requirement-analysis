Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the process of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
It provides definitions, importance, key activities, types of requirements, diagrams, and acceptance criteria for a booking management system project.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.

It ensures that all stakeholders share a clear and common understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

Requirement Analysis acts as the foundation for design, development, and testing, minimizing ambiguity and aligning the project with business needs.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarity and Understanding – Ensures all stakeholders understand the system requirements, reducing ambiguity.

Scope Definition – Clearly defines the project boundaries, preventing scope creep.

Basis for Design and Development – Provides a foundation for building accurate designs and system architecture.

Cost and Time Estimation – Helps estimate resources, timeline, and project costs more effectively.

Quality Assurance – Ensures the final product meets expectations, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering: Collecting needs from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, observation, and document reviews.

Requirement Elicitation: Refining gathered requirements via brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.

Requirement Documentation: Writing requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Prioritizing requirements, assessing feasibility, and creating models like DFDs or ERDs.

Requirement Validation: Reviewing requirements with stakeholders, defining acceptance criteria, and ensuring traceability.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements

These describe what the system should do.
Examples for the booking management system:

Search Properties: Users can search by location, price, and availability.

User Registration: Users can create accounts with personal details.

Property Listings: Display properties with details and images.

Booking System: Users can book properties, view details, and manage reservations.

User Authentication: Secure login and registration process.

Non-Functional Requirements

These describe how the system should perform.
Examples:

Performance: System should load within 2 seconds and handle 1000+ concurrent users.

Security: Encrypt data, secure login, and protect against vulnerabilities.

Scalability: Support horizontal scaling to handle traffic growth.

Usability: Intuitive UI/UX for easy navigation.

Reliability: Ensure 99.9% uptime with quick recovery from failures.

Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system (use cases).

They help clarify system functionalities, improve communication, and validate requirements.

Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.

They ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and aligned with user expectations.

Example – Checkout Feature

Users must be able to select available dates.

Users must confirm their booking and see a booking summary.

A confirmation email must be sent within 2 minutes of successful booking.

The system should prevent double-booking of the same property.

Benefits of Acceptance Criteria:

Provides clarity for developers and testers.

Ensures all parties agree on “done.”

Maintains product quality and user satisfaction.
